/**
 * The title layout (not implemented yet).
 * It arranges the child views of the associated view in rows and columns.
 *
 * Based on the given width, minWidth and maxWidth, it arranges views from left
 * to right, and starts a new row when there is no enough zoom for a view.
 *
 * [LayoutDeclaration] of the associated view provides the default width and height
 * for each child view, while [ProfileDeclaration] of
 * each child view, if specified, controls how a child view is arranged different
 * including width, minWidth, minHeight, maxWidth and so on.
 *
 * In additions, you can control the alignment and spacing with `align`,
 * `spacing` and `gap`.
 *
 * It is useful for responsive Web design, since the tile layout will
 * arrange child views in additional rows, if they can't fit into a row.
