##Compile LESS to CSS

Rikulo CSS rules are written in [view.less](https://github.com/rikulo/rikulo/blob/master/resources/css/view.less). If you modify it, you have to invoke [bin/lesscss](https://github.com/rikulo/rikulo/blob/master/bin/lesscss) to generate [view.css](https://github.com/rikulo/rikulo/blob/master/resources/css/view.css) (under Linux or Cygwin bash).
